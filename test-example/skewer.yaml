title: Skupper Hello World
subtitle: A minimal HTTP application deployed across Kubernetes clusters using Skupper
github_actions_url: https://github.com/skupperproject/skewer/actions/workflows/main.yaml
overview: |
  This example is a very simple multi-service HTTP application that can
  be deployed across multiple Kubernetes clusters using Skupper.

  It contains two services:

  * A backend service that exposes an `/api/hello` endpoint.  It
    returns greetings of the form `Hi, <your-name>.  I am <my-name>
    (<pod-name>)`.

  * A frontend service that sends greetings to the backend and
    fetches new greetings in response.

  With Skupper, you can place the backend in one cluster and the
  frontend in another and maintain connectivity between the two
  services without exposing the backend to the public internet.

  - title: Deploy the frontend and backend services
    preamble: |
      Use `kubectl create deployment` to deploy the frontend service
      in `west` and the backend service in `east`.
    commands:
      west:
        - run: kubectl create deployment frontend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-frontend
          output: deployment.apps/frontend created
      east:
        - run: kubectl create deployment backend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-backend --replicas 3
          output: deployment.apps/backend created
  - title: Expose the backend service
    preamble: |
      We now have two namespaces linked to form a Skupper network, but
      no services are exposed on it.  Skupper uses the `skupper
      expose` command to select a service from one namespace for
      exposure on all the linked namespaces.

      Use `skupper expose` to expose the backend service to the
      frontend service.
    commands:
      east:
        - await: deployment/backend
        - run: skupper expose deployment/backend --port 8080
          output: deployment backend exposed as backend
  - title: Expose the frontend service
    preamble: |
      We have established connectivity between the two namespaces and
      made the backend in `east` available to the frontend in `west`.
      Before we can test the application, we need external access to
      the frontend.

      Use `kubectl expose` with `--type LoadBalancer` to open network
      access to the frontend service.
    commands:
      west:
        - await: deployment/frontend
        - run: kubectl expose deployment/frontend --port 8080 --type LoadBalancer
          output: service/frontend exposed
  - standard: test_the_application
accessing_the_web_console:
  preamble: |
    Skupper includes a web console you can use to view the application
    network.  To access it, use `kubectl get service/skupper` to look
    up the external IP of the web console.  Then use `kubectl get
    secret/skupper-console-users` to look up the console admin
    password.

    **Note:** The `<external-ip>` and `<password>` fields in the
    following commands are placeholders.  The actual values are
    specific to your environment.
  commands:
    west:
      - run: kubectl get service/skupper
        apply: readme
        output: |
          NAME       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)                           AGE
          skupper    LoadBalancer   10.96.54.251    <external-ip>   8080:31616/TCP,8081:30642/TCP     3m34s
      - run: kubectl get secret/skupper-console-users -o jsonpath={.data.admin} | base64 -d
        apply: readme
        output: <password>
      - await_external_ip: service/skupper
      - run: curl --fail --insecure --verbose --retry 60 --retry-connrefused --retry-delay 2 $(kubectl get service/skupper -o jsonpath='https://{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}:8080/') --user admin:$(kubectl get secret/skupper-console-users -o jsonpath={.data.admin} | base64 -d)
        apply: test
  postamble: |
    Navigate to `https://<external-ip>:8080/` in your browser.  When
    prompted, log in as user `admin` and enter the password.
summary: |
  This example locates the frontend and backend services in different
  namespaces, on different clusters.  Ordinarily, this means that they
  have no way to communicate unless they are exposed to the public
  internet.

  Introducing Skupper into each namespace allows us to create a virtual
  application network that can connect services in different clusters.
  Any service exposed on the application network is represented as a
  local service in all of the linked namespaces.

  The backend service is located in `east`, but the frontend service
  in `west` can "see" it as if it were local.  When the frontend
  sends a request to the backend, Skupper forwards the request to the
  namespace where the backend is running and routes the response back to
  the frontend.
