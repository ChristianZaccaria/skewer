title: Skupper Hello World
subtitle: A minimal HTTP application deployed across Kubernetes clusters using Skupper
github_actions_url: https://github.com/skupperproject/skewer/actions/workflows/main.yaml
overview: |-
  This example is a very simple multi-service HTTP application that can
  be deployed across multiple Kubernetes clusters using Skupper.

  It contains two services:

  * A backend service that exposes an `/api/hello` endpoint.  It
    returns greetings of the form `Hello from <pod-name>
    (<request-count>)`.

  * A frontend service that accepts HTTP requests, calls the backend
    to fetch new greetings, and serves them to the user.

  With Skupper, you can place the backend in one cluster and the
  frontend in another and maintain connectivity between the two
  services without exposing the backend to the public internet.

    commands:
      west:
        - run: skupper init

      east:

          await: [deployment/skupper-service-controller, deployment/skupper-router]
    postamble: |-
      Here we are using `--ingress none` in `east` simply to make
      local development with Minikube easier.  (It's tricky to run two
      minikube tunnels on one host.)  The `--ingress none` option is
      not required if your two namespaces are on different hosts or on
      public clusters.
  - title: Check the status of your namespaces
    preamble: |-
      Use `skupper status` in each console to check that Skupper is
      installed:
    commands:
      - run: skupper status
        output: |-
          Skupper is enabled for namespace "west" in interior mode. It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
          The site console url is: http://10.98.13.241:8080
          The credentials for internal console-auth mode are held in secret: 'skupper-console-users'

      As you move through the steps below, you can use `skupper status` at
      any time to check your progress.
  - title: Link your namespaces
    preamble: !string link_your_namespaces_preamble
    commands:
      west:
        - run: skupper token create ~/west.token
      east:
        - run: skupper link create ~/west.token
        - run: skupper link status --wait 30
    postamble: !string link_your_namespaces_postamble
  - title: Deploy the backend and frontend services
    preamble: |-
      Use `kubectl create deployment` to deploy the services.
    commands:
      west:
        - run: kubectl create deployment hello-world-frontend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-frontend
          await: [deployment/hello-world-frontend]
      east:
        - run: kubectl create deployment hello-world-backend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-backend
          await: [deployment/hello-world-backend]
  - title: Expose your services
    commands:
      west:
        - run: kubectl expose deployment/hello-world-frontend --port 8080 --type LoadBalancer
          sleep: 30
      east:
        - run: skupper expose deployment/hello-world-backend --port 8080
          sleep: 30
  - title: Test your application
    commands:
      west:
        - run: "curl $(kubectl get service hello-world-frontend -o jsonpath='http://{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}:8080/')"
          output: I am the frontend.  The backend says 'Hello from hello-world-backend-869cd94f69-wh6zt (1)'.
summary: |-
  This example locates the frontend and backend services in different
  namespaces, on different clusters.  Ordinarily, this means that they
  have no way to communicate unless they are exposed to the public
  internet.

  Introducing Skupper into each namespace allows us to create a virtual
  application network that can connect services in different clusters.
  Any service exposed on the application network is represented as a
  local service in all of the linked namespaces.

  The backend service is located in `east`, but the frontend service
  in `west` can "see" it as if it were local.  When the frontend
  sends a request to the backend, Skupper forwards the request to the
  namespace where the backend is running and routes the response back to
  the frontend.
